The rise of open data in the public sector has sparked innovation, driven efficiency, and fueled economic development. And in the vein of high-profile federal initiatives like Data.gov and the White House’s Open Government Initiative, more and more governments at the local level are making their foray into the field with Chief Data Officers, open data policies, and open data catalogs.

開放政府資料的風起雲湧，促成了創新、廉效以及經濟發展。在指標性的聯邦計畫的帶領之下，如 Data.gov 和白宮的開放政府計畫 (Open Government Initiative) 啟動之後，有越來越多地方政府透過資料長、開放資料政策以及資料目錄而進一步的發展。

While still emerging, we are seeing evidence of the transformative potential of open data in shaping the future of our cities. It’s at the city level that government most directly impacts the lives of residents—providing clean parks, fighting crime, or issuing permits to open a new business. This is where there is the biggest opportunity to use open data to reimagine the relationship between citizens and government.

雖然仍是未定之天，我們還是衷心希望，能找到支撐開放資料從根本改變城市發展的重要證據。舉凡公園環境維護、打擊犯罪，或是取得營業登記許可，地方政府的運作和我們的生活息息相關。這部份其實是開放資料重新定義市民和政府關係的最佳契機。

And as momentum grows and norms are set, we reach a critical turning point in the trajectory of the movement. As a community, we need to be reflective, mindful, and adaptive. We must take stock of what’s worked so far and what we still need to learn in order to ensure we are driving towards meaningful, sustainable outcomes.

隨著越來越多的動能匯集，我們到達了發展的轉捩點。身為社群的一份子，我們必須更為適切反應和深思。我們必須好好的記住什麼已經成功運作，以及還有什麼是我們必須多加學習，來驅動更有意義和永續的成果。

*Beyond Transparency* is a cross-disciplinary survey of the open data landscape, in which practitioners share their own stories of what they’ve accomplished with open data. It seeks to move beyond the rhetoric of transparency for transparency’s sake and towards action and problem solving. Through these stories, we examine what is needed to build an ecosystem in which open data can become the raw materials to drive more effective decision-making and efficient service delivery, spur economic activity, and empower citizens to take an active role in improving their own communities.

*Beyond Transparency* 一書是一本針對來自各界的開放資料實務工作者之全面性普查成果，撰述之目的在於超越僅僅是為了透明而透明的傳統訴求，以行動和解決問題導向為本書基調。從這些故事當中，我們可以了解如何建立良好的開放資料生態系統，讓更為有效的決策，能夠透過原始資料來支持，提供更為良好的服務，促進經濟活動，並且賦權市民，讓市民可以在他們的社區（社群）扮演更為積極的角色。

### How This Book Came to Be

The idea for this book originated while I was in my role as Chief Information Officer for the City of Chicago. I was often flooded with requests of how to replicate the Chicago “success story” with open data. Some essays had been written to talk about implementations using specific vendor platforms. This was valuable, but I felt it required a broader approach. The more I thought about it, the more I came to believe that the moment was right for a “guidebook” of sorts that documented the successes and lessons learned of open civic data so far.

這本書源自於我在芝加哥市任職為資訊長的期間。我在過去一直被問到如何複製芝加哥市的成功經驗。有些媒體提到了我們所採取的特定軟體平台，這件事很重要沒錯，但是當我更深入的思考，我更相信目前這個時間點亟需一本好的「導覽手冊」，算是記錄目前為止關於開放政府資料的成功和所學習到的課題。

I had become acquainted with Jennifer Pahlka, founder of Code for America, through the City of Chicago’s engagement as a Code for America Fellowship city in 2012. We had built a trusting relationship through our discussions related to Code for America’s work in Chicago, and continued to get to know each other at the ongoing stream of open government and civic innovation conferences, meetings, and events that we both frequented. As I pondered how to push forward this idea of marking a milestone in civic open data, Jen was an obvious ally.

在2012年當芝加哥獲選 Code for America Fellowship 城市的同時，我認識了 Code for America 的創辦人 Jennifer Pahlka。我們和 Code for America 在思考芝加哥市要如何發展的過程，藉由各種開放政府、市民創新大會、一般會議，建立了相當的互信關係。當我在想怎麼把開放政府資料往前推進一步的同時，Jen 很顯然是好的聯盟。

I reached out to Jen with a big idea: let’s write a book on open data. For two busy professionals, this seemed like a herculean task, but a plan came together that leveraged the resources of Code For America along with the insights of key players in the data space. Jen was enthusiastic and pulled together a team from Code for America to support the project. Within a few weeks, we had an initial list of contributors signed on. Within a few months we had chapter drafts in hand and a working outline of the book. A good idea coupled with agile execution—in many ways, the way this book was created embodies principles of the open data movement in and of itself.

我給了 Jen 一個重要的點子：讓我們來寫一本關於開放資料的書。這件事對於兩個日務繁忙到不行的人來說，簡直是不可能的任務，但在 Code for America 資源的挹注之下，幾位關鍵者的加入，讓這本書慢慢的成形。Jen 當時很興奮，並且很快的從 Code for America 拉出一組人馬來協助這個計畫。在幾週之內，我們就有了一份協同作者的清單。在幾個越之後，我們就有了各個章節的草稿，也準備進入編輯的流程。當好的點子遇到敏捷的執行能力時 - 在很多方面來說，本書的付梓都展現了開放資料本身的精神。

### What Does This Book Seek to Do?

### 這本書希望達成什麼？

*Beyond Transparency* is a resource for (and by) practitioners inside and outside government—from the municipal chief information officer to the community organizer to the civic-minded entrepreneur. We aim for this book to accomplish a few specific things.

*Beyond Transparency* 是來自於政府內部和外部實務工作的良好資源 - 從地方政府的資訊長到社群活躍份子，或是市民導向的新創企業家。我們希望本書能達成幾個具體的期許。

For a local government looking to start an open data program, we hope the lessons outlined here will help them do exactly that.

對於正要啟動開放資料計畫的地方政府，我們希望下列的故事，能協助你們也能做到。

We want to spark a discussion of where open data will go next—and how we, as practitioners, can be smarter, more effective, and more broadly impactful.

我們希望引起廣泛討論開放資料的下一步會是什麼 - 身為實務工作者，如何更聰明、更有效率，以及帶來更大的影響。

We want to help community members (technologists and otherwise) outside of government better engage with the process of governance and improve our public institutions.

我們希望協助在政府體系之外的社群成員（技術愛好者或是其他）能夠在政府治理的過程扮演更多的角色，以改善我們的公共機構。

And we want lend a voice to many aspects of the open data community. In this book, you’ll see perspectives from many different participants that comprise an open data ecosystem: public servants, community organizers, NGOs, technologists, designers, researchers, journalists, and citizens. With *Beyond Transparency*, we’ve brought together a diverse cross-section of the field’s top innovators and leaders to share their stories of what has been achieved with open data so far, what they’ve learned along the way, and how we can apply those lessons to realize a more promising future for America’s cities. As they look back on what’s been accomplished so far—and what is yet to come—emergent themes resonate throughout their stories.

而且我們希望替很多的開放資料社群發聲。在這本書，你可以閱讀到許多來自開放資料生態圈不同的觀點：從政府雇員、社區營造者、非政府組織、技術愛好者、設計者、研究人員、新聞媒體從業和市民等。藉由 *Beyond Transparency* 我們帶出豐富跨界的的創新者和領導者，分享他們的故事，講述透過開放資料而做到了什麼。在這一路上學到了什麼教訓，而我們又能從他們的身上反思如何為美國建立更好的未來。當他們回顧過去時 - 同時也在想著還有什麼沒有做到，這些都確實的響應了本書的各節故事。

As the title of this book suggests, the community is realizing the need to look beyond the rationale of transparency and instead align open data efforts with policy objectives, applying it to solve problems that really matter and make better decisions about how to allocate scarce resources. We also hear again and again the need for citizen-centered design that borrows principles from the User Experience field to move from data that is open to data that is truly usable and accessible by the public. Many practitioners cite the need for open data standards—across various types of civic data—to increase interoperability and make impact scalable. These are just some of the ideas and lessons that emerge from the stories gathered here.

如同本書的書名，社群已經開始理解到必須跨過為了透明而透明的階段，進而發展政策的目標，解決至關重要的問題，做出更好的決策，以及如何優化資源的分配等。我們也不時聽到開放資料應該導入市民導向設計原則的呼籲，讓資料不只是開放而已，還要有用，並且便於取得。這些原則來自於使用者經驗的設計領域。很多實務工作者表示開放資料的標準相當重要，目的是增加資料之間的通透性，並且讓所創造的效益能夠放大。以上都只是本書內的部分例子。

As we look forward, this is an exciting point in time. We have proven the value of open data. We have shown it can be done in short order, in cities of all sizes, from Chicago to Asheville, North Carolina. And now it is up to all of us to carry on the work that has been started.

當我們更往前看時，會發現這是一個令人驚喜的時間點。我們已經證明開放資料的價值。我們已經展現了這可以在各種規模的城市，從芝加哥到北卡的 Ashville，在短時間內達成目標。是否繼續前行，取決於我們所有人的決定。
